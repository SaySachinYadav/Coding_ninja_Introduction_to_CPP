#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 15;
    if(x <= 15) {
        cout << "Inside if ";
    } else if(x == 15) {
        cout << "Inside else if ";
    }
    cout << x;
}



Correct Answer: Inside if 15 



Solution Description
The condition inside if is true, hence statement "Inside if" will be printed. After that, we'll directly jump to statement : cout << x. So, after that 15 will be printed.

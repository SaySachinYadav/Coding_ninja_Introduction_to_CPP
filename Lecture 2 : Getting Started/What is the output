What will be the output of the following code ?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "career" << "labs";
}


Correct Answer: careerlabs


Solution Description:
The text will be printed exactly like we placed inside double quotes. So first we are printing "career". 
After printing, our cursor will be right next to the 'r' of "carrer". So "labs" will be printed right next 
to the "career" without any spaces between them.

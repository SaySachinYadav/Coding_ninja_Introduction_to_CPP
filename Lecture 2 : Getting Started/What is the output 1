What will be the output of the following code ?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << code ;
}


Correct Answer: Error


Solution Description:
If we want to print something on screen exactly, we need to put that text in double quotes, otherwise error will come. For eg. cout << "code";

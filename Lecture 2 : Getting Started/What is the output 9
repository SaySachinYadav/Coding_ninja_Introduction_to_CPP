What is the output ?


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    char ch = 'a';
    ch = ch + a;
    cout << ch << endl;
}


Answer:  k



Solution Description
We know that the addition of a character and an integer leads to an integer. 
So the statement - "ch + a" will give the answer 107 (ASCII value of 'a' is 97). But we are assigning this integer now to the character variable. 
Hence, 107 will be saved in the variable "ch" and on printing it will print the character which is having ASCII value 107 i.e. 'k'.
